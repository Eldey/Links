This file is about some precision about the code of Links.

- An error is still present, it happens when the method loadGraph of displayedGraph is called.
	The error is in Graphstream, it is an error in the queue of event for the graph.
	The error has never appered at the same time, it is random but you have less chance to get this error if you create your experience
	and then you visualize it.

- Links use LxPlot but all the chart are not included in Links

- The code to import and export an xp takes a lot of place in the XpChooser, a class can be created just for it
	but I don't think it will be used.
